I have noticed spelling mistake in the title - "Pokemon Trianer Details", I would raise this with the developers but wouldn't say this is a blocker for merging as according to the ACs the functionality isn't affected and I don't have the design spec to refer to. Having said that of course if I had the design spec this would block merge.<br>
Also noticed that the Pokemon overall score is not in-line with the name but again as I haven't been given a design spec, this won't block merge.<br>
<br>
**TC04** - AC is not met as Pikachu's stats don't show so will block merge <br>
**TC07** - AC is not met as a required field is left empty and successful form registration alert is still shown so will block merge.<br>
**TC09** - AC is not met as user is only notified about 'Starter Pokemon' field and not 'Name' field so will block merge
